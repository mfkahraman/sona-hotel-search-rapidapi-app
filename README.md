## 📘 Sona Hotel Search

**Sona Hotel Search** is a simple hotel search application built with ASP.NET Core MVC.  
The goal of this project was to practice and enhance my skills in API consumption using RapidAPI.

Users can:

- Search for hotels using filters like check-in/check-out dates, number of adults, and room quantity  
- View popular places for the selected destination  
- Interact with a fully functional UI built using Bootstrap  

All hotel and destination data is fetched from the **Booking.com API** via **RapidAPI**.  
I used `HttpClient` to make API requests, and practiced:

- Building request URLs dynamically  
- Adding headers and authorization  
- Sending parameters via query strings or request bodies  

This project helped me reinforce my experience with API integration, which I already apply regularly in my current job.
